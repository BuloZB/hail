This daemon implements a very simple PUT/GET/DELETE data storage
service over a custom binary network protocol.  It is intended to be
used as a low-level piece of large-scale data storage infrastructure.

The service provides operations on stored data ("objects").

An object is simply an anonymous blob of any length, indexed by a similarly
opaque key, 1-1024 bytes in size.

When you PUT (upload) an object, you receive in return a hash value
(currently SHA-1), that may be used for optional end-to-end integrity
checking.

From this basic service interface

        PUT (key, value)
                <- (key, key len, data, data len)
                -> (sha-1 hash)

        GET (key)
                -> (len, sha-1 hash, data)

        DELETE (key)

See include/chunk_msg.h for the full network protocol definition in C.

Using chunkd, you can build cluster-wide redundant storage services,
exporting data storage capability from any device supported by your OS.
