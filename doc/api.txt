Interface overview, in a nutshell
=================================
        PUT (key, value)
                <- (key, key len, data, data len)
                -> (sha-1 hash)

        GET (key)
                -> (len, sha-1 hash, data)

        DELETE (key)

There are no provisions for updating objects.  An update is accomplished via
GET+DELETE+PUT.

Objects must be retrieved and stored in full.

See include/chunk_msg.h for full network protocol specification in C.



Keys
=================================
Keys are opaque binary strings, from 1 byte to 1,024 bytes in size.



Authentication and access control
=================================
At present, the header signature is verified, but we merely verify that
username==password, the minimum level of authentication necessary to prove
that it works.  It does not yet actually authenticate against any password
database.


CLD intergration
================

This feature may be changing (before version 1.0 especially), so reading
the file server/cldu.c is probably the best guide.
