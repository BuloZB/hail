Interface overview, in a nutshell
=================================
        PUT $COOKIE
                <- (len, data)
                -> (sha-1 hash)

        GET $COOKIE
                -> (len, sha-1 hash, data)

        DELETE $COOKIE

There are no provisions for updating objects.  An update is accomplished via
GET+DELETE+PUT.

See include/chunk_msg.h for full network protocol specification in C.



Special note about COOKIE strings
=================================
The object key, referred to above as $COOKIE, must consist only of lowercase
hexidecimal digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f

There is no internal limit on the length of the object key; however the URI
length limit in practice limits the object key length.

Each cookie must be at least 7 characters.



Authentication and access control
=================================
At present, the header signature is verified, but we merely verify that
username==password, the minimum level of authentication necessary to prove
that it works.  It does not yet actually authenticate against any password
database.


CLD intergration
================

This feature may be changing (before version 1.0 especially), so reading
the file server/cldu.c is probably the best guide.
