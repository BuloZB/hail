chcli is a general purpose command line interface to chunkd.

Examples of usage:

1) Storing a record.  Username "user", password "user", host 127.0.0.1,
   port 38455, key "age", value "99".

$ CHCLI_PASSWORD=user tools/chcli -h 127.0.0.1:38455 -u user	\
	put name "Jeff Garzik"



2) Retrieving a record, to stdout.  Username "user", password "user",
   host 127.0.0.1, port 38455, key "age", value "99".

$ CHCLI_PASSWORD=user tools/chcli -h 127.0.0.1:38455 -u user	\
	get name
Jeff Garzik


Keys provided on the command line (as opposed to via -k) are stored
with a C-style nul terminating character appended, adding 1 byte to
each key.

See chcli.cfg for an example configuration file.
